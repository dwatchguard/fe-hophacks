Characters:
	BUG: Swordsman (starts UG seeking knowledge about self -> bUG willing to
		sacrifice to improve and starts seeing both the WUB and the WBG
		civilizations as unnatural -> BUG regarding followers as an extension of
		 himself and fiercely protective of them because they're his.)
	BUR: Rogue (starts UB knowledge and power -> BUR with battles bringing out
		rage/ferocity. More willing to throw her friends under the bus that BUG.
		BUG would say that's poor resource management.)
	BW: horse? (Looking for power from within establishment. Fire nation-like
		motivation. "Our country is awesome. Everyone should be part of it.
		Participation is mandatory.") probably npc
	BWR: Soldier (Starts RW freedom fighter against increasing control from BW
		-> BWR and this freedom, for myself and others, is worth any sacrifice.)
	RGW: Warrior (Starts GW, disturbed by WUB's mistreatment of citizens -> RGW
		moved to action for the betterment of the many.)
	WRU: Priest lean cleric

Factions:
	WUB: Knowledge/goal focused society. Willing to shelve morals (at least in
		private) for advancement. Government is always watching you.
	WBG: Community focused society. Communism vibe. Other citizens
		are always watching you.

WUB and WBG are two countries with a lot of ideological tension. They aren't at
war, per se, but there's a lot of small scale conflict (raids, spying, and such)
that goes on between them. There's probably an environmental barrier that makes
war a hassle, but not impossible.

UG and BU are part of the command group of an elite (experimental?) military
group in WUB, under BW's command. (~3 other player characters in same group,
possibly WRU as well) Group is super successful while getting increasingly
concerned about events at home. BW has to shut the group down for political
reasons. bUG and BUr try to publicly expose BW, but this ends up failing and
bUG ends up in gladiator style games and BUr ends up hunted in the undercity,
falling in with some gangs. Somewhere in here, war between WUB and WBG starts in
earnest.

bUG and BUr get separated into two parties, with no other PCs. (The previously
introduced ones come back later.) If we can make 1vX combat interesting somehow,
each could have a solo chapter or two. BUG adds RW to the party and BUR adds GW.

BUG gets a message from a mysterious stranger offering escape help if BUG beats
the current champ. BUG and bWR fight their way through the gladiator ring,
fighting, among others, some of bWR's revolutionary/resistance comrades. They
beat the champ and get some roundabout (borderline circumstantial) help
escaping. The escape lands them in WBG territory, with one of the previous
party members and WRU.

Meanwhile, BUR takes over a rival gang or two and starts trying to increase her
influence. She decides that WUB is the biggest obstacle/next stepping stone to
conquer so she forms an alliance with the resistance, and turns it from an just
an annoyance to WUB to a large, internal threat. Over a few chapters the rest of
the previous party members and a few gang/resistance members join up with BUR.

BUG moves through WBG, trying to spread freedom, fighting the governors of
communities that want him to. Lots of Defeat Boss wincons. Recruits at least one
boss who thinks he's right about WBG being kinda shitty, as well as some people
from the communities who buy in. (Probably also one who leaves a community
that's happy under WBG rule)

WUB and WBG both start to realize that BUG and BUR are pretty big problems.
Until now BUG and BUR were fighting forces left over after other people went off
to the war, but now they start calling (stronger) forces back to deal with the
problem.
