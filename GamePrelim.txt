    Magic (MAG):
        Default damage stat for magical attacks
    Skill (SKL):

        Used to calculate hit, avoid, and critical chances, as well as doubled
            attacks.

			cold, etc.)

Buildings - ALPHA
    Buildings provide area of effect bonuses to the controlling army. They can
    be captured (using CHA) or destroyed (by attacking them), as well as
    repaired and fortified (TODO Repair and fortify mechanics).

Damage Types
    Physical:
        Damage from mundane weapons; reduced by defense.
    Magic:
        Damage from magical weapons; reduced by resistance.
    Environment:
        Damage from exposure, poison, etc.; reduced by constitution.
    True:
        Damage from exceptional sources; not reduced.

Combat Calculations
    Hit = WeaponHit + 2 * SKL + SPD + other bonuses
    Avo = 2 * SPD + SKL + other bonuses
    Damage = WeaponDamage + attack stat - enemy defense
        Which attributes are used for attack and defense
        is   determined by the weapon.

    Crit = WeaponCrit + SKL
    Dodge = SPD + 1/2 * SKL
    Critical Damage = Normal Damage + attack stat
		(Instead of 3x, does 1x normal + 1x true damage)

        Achieving Weapon Mastery
            Battling using a weapon or using a staff grants 2 WEXP of the same
            type as the weapon the character used.

            Required cumulative WEXP
                -       0
                E       1       (Normally, - to E is caused by class change.)
                D       31
                C       71
                B       121
                A       181
                S       250

    Combat Triangle Bonuses
        (-> = Beat)
        Sword and Tomes -> Axe and Bow -> Lance and Knife -> Sword and Tomes
        Tomes:
            Dark -> Anima -> Light -> Dark
            Fire -> Wind -> Lightning -> Fire

        Bonuses are based on the weapon rank of the character with advantage.
		The character without advantage receives the negative of the following
        bonus. (For example, B rank swordsman attacks A rank axeman. The
        swordsman gets Hit +10, Atk +1 and the axeman gets Hit -10, Atk -1)
            E   Hit +5
            D   Hit +5
            C   Hit +10
            B   Hit +10, Attack +1
            A   Hit +15, Attack +1, Crit +5
            S   Hit +20, Attack +2, Crit +5


Character Leveling
    Characters earn EXP by attacking, defending, healing, etc. Once they reach
    100 EXP, they grow a level and reset EXP to 0. On growing a level, all of
    their skills have a chance to grow. That chance depends on their growth rate
    for that particular stat.

    Characters have a max level of 20. Once they reach LVL 20 EXP 100, they
    class change. They grow into a more powerful and more specialized version of
    their current class. There are three tiers of classes.

    A character will learn a class skill upon reaching T1 LVL 10 and on class
    changing into a new class. They will upgrade the skill from the previous
	tier on reaching level 10 in the next tier. Characters learn an additional
    capstone skill at T3 LVL 15.

Experience Calculations
    Total Level
        T1  level
        T2  20 + level
        T3  40 + level

    (LD = Foe's total level - ally's total level)
    Battling, but dealing no damage grants 1 EXP.
    Dealing damage grants
        10 + (LD * abs(LD))/4       (minimum 5)
    Killing blows grant an additional
        LD + 15 + 5 * (Tier difference) + boss EXP
        Tier difference is enemy tier - ally tier
        Boss EXP is 40 if the enemy was a boss, 0 otherwise
